<h3 class="section">6.3 Comma Separated Lists</h3>

<p><a name="index-comma-separated-lists-358"></a>
Comma separated lists are the basic argument type to all Octave
functions. In the example

<pre class="example">     max (<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><var>a</var><code>, </code><var>b</var> is a comma separated list. Comma separated lists
can appear on both the right and left hand side of an equation. For
example

<pre class="example">     [<var>i</var>, <var>j</var>] = ceil (find (<var>x</var>, [], "last"));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>i</var><code>, </code><var>j</var> is equally a comma separated list. Comma
separated lists can not be directly manipulated by the user. However,
both structures are cell arrays can be converted into comma
separated lists, which makes them useful to keep the input arguments and
return values of functions organized. Another example of where a comma
separated list can be used is in the creation of a new array. If all the
accessed elements of a cell array are scalars or column vectors, they
can be concatenated into a new column vector containing the elements, by
surrounding the list with <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> as in the following
example

<pre class="example">     a = {1, [2, 3], 4};
     b = [a{:}]
           b =
              1   2   3   4
</pre>
   <p>It is also possible to pass the accessed elements directly to a
function.  The list of elements from the cell array will be passed as an
argument list to a given function as if it is called with the elements as
arguments.  The two calls to <code>printf</code> in the following example are
identical but the latter is simpler and handles more situations

<pre class="example">     c = {"GNU", "Octave", "is", "Free", "Software"};
     printf ("%s ", c{1}, c{2}, c{3}, c{4}, c{5});
          -| GNU Octave is Free Software
     printf ("%s ", c{:});
          -| GNU Octave is Free Software
</pre>
   <p>Just like it is possible to create a numerical array from selected
elements of a cell array, it is possible to create a new cell array
containing the selected elements. By surrounding the list with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo; a new cell array will be created, like the
following example illustrates

<pre class="example">     a = {1, rand(2, 2), "three"};
     b = { a{ [1, 3] } }
           b =
              {
                [1,1] =  1
                [1,2] = three
              }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This syntax is however a bit cumbersome, and since this is a common
operation, it is possible to achieve the same using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; operators for indexing. When a cell array is indexed
using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; operators a new cell array containing
the selected elements. Using this syntax, the previous example can
be simplified into the following

<pre class="example">     a = {1, rand(2, 2), "three"};
     b = a( [1, 3] )
           b =
              {
                [1,1] =  1
                [1,2] = three
              }
</pre>
   <p>A comma separated list can equally appear on the left-hand side of an
assignment. An example is

<pre class="example">     in {1} = ceil (rand (10, 1));
     in {2} = [];
     in {3} = "last";
     in {4} = "first";
     out = cell (4, 1);
     [out{1:2}] = find (in{1 : 3});
     [out{3:4}] = find (in{[1, 2, 4]});
</pre>
   <p>Structure arrays can equally be used to create comma separated
lists. This is done by addresses one of the fields of a structure
array. For example

<pre class="example">     x = ceil (randn (10, 1));
     in = struct ("call1", {x, Inf, "last"},
                  "call2", {x, Inf, "first"});
     out = struct ("call1", cell (2, 1), "call2", cell (2, 1));
     [out.call1] = find (in.call1);
     [out.call2] = find (in.call2);
